# AP-FRQs-2025

*Solutions written by Gordon Wu*

## Introduction
This repository contains my solutions and reflections for the AP Computer Science exam taken on May 7th, 2025. While reviewing the released questions, I've documented my approach, insights gained, and areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience
In this section, I reflect on my overall experience taking the AP Computer Science exam:

- My preparation strategy for the exam included fully completing and reviewing the AP-CSA textbook issued to me earlier in the year, alongside reviewing certain assignments i've completed for the AP-CSA cirriculum. 
- The most challenging aspects of the exam were questions pertaining to subclasses, as I didn't fully review them properly which led to my lack of complete understanding regarding the subject. 
- Time management techniques that worked well for me, mainly included switching through multiple questions in an attempt to complete easy questions first, before moving back to questions that would've taken more time.
- Mental strategies I used when encountering difficult questions 

## Growth Opportunities
Through this review process, I've identified these areas for continued learning:

- Topic/Concept 1: [Brief description of what to improve]
- Topic/Concept 2: [Brief description of what to improve]
- Programming practice: [Specific practice goals]

## Resources
Resources I found helpful during my exam preparation and review:

- [Resource name and link]

## Future Goals
Moving forward, I plan to:
- [Specific goal related to computer science learning]
- [Project idea inspired by the exam content]
- Although I don't plan on taking future courses in college that are explicitely coding based, I am taking a few courses for CYBSEC. However, my course mainly pertains to the applications and risk of data infrastructure, and   students can allocate and direct responses to cyber-attacks in their future workplaces. Therefore I don't really recall having any explicit learning stratergies that I've gleamed from this class that'd be helpful in such     circumstances.
